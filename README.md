> A flashcards web application that creates decks of flashcards, and allows the user to make new decks, edit them, and delete them through it's local API. The user can give each deck a title and description, and customize the cards inside them. The cards are designed with a front and back side, and the user can &#34;study&#34; them. Studying the cards in a deck is simulated by cycling through all of the cards.
